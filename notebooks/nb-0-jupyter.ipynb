    "A Jupyter Notebook is a powerful data science tool. It allows you to use a web browser (as opposed to a terminal or other software) to interact with a computer language interpreter (typically Python) to send commands and receive outputs. The content of a notebook is organized into discrete *cells*, each of which can contain either code or text. These are usually interspersed to create documents that combine cells with textual instructions and explanations inbetween cells with executable code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be styled using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to improve presentation (more on this below), and code is displayed nicely with syntax highlighting which colors different code elements to make them more easily recognizable. Outputs from the interpreter (e.g., Python) such as returned values, tables, or plots, are displayed in HTML below executed cells. Both text and code can be edited and executed, creating an interactive document that can be easily shared online."

    "Markdown is a simple language/method for *styling* text in web-based documents. The text you see above is written in Markdown, which provided a simple way to create large and bold font in headers, bullet points, and links. You can double-click on any Markdown cell to see the underlying *code* that creates the styled text. This can be a great way to learn Markdown, by reading examples. In addition, it will be useful to read through a full [Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) sometime to see the full capabilities of this language (though you don't need to do so right now).

    "To edit a cell you must first select it. Do this by hovering over it with your cursor and clicking on the cell. You should see a thin rectangle appear around the cell which will appear either blue or green. A blue outline indicates the cell has been selected whereas a green outline indicates you have entered 'editing mode', such that you can change the contents of the cell.\n",

    "Double click on a cell to enter 'editing mode' and edit its contents. Try this with the cell below this one. You will see the cell expand and the text will appear as plain text as opposed to *rendered text*. You can then edit the content. When finished editing you will need to *execute* the cell again to return the text to its rendered state. To execute a notebook cell hold the shift key down and press enter: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>. You can also double-click this cell to examine the Markdown, which includes an example of how I created the key-stroke buttons for shift and enter. \n",

When you edit and execute the cell you should see large bold formatted text on the first line, followed by normal formatted text for the second line. If not, try editing the text again, you may have included spaces, or other errors. \n",

The two main types we are interested in are Markdown cells, as you just saw above, and *Code* cells, which are used to execute code. Execute the Code cell below by selecting the cell with you cursor and pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>. You should see a value returned in the output region below the cell. This is a simple snippet of Python code. You can edit the code, for example by changing the value of `x` from 3 to 5, and re-execute the cell, and you will see a different value in the output. "
