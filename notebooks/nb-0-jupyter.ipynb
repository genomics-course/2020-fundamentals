    "A Jupyter Notebook is a powerful data science tool. It allows you to use a web browser (as opposed to a terminal or other software) to interact with a computer language interpreter (typically Python) to send commands and receive outputs. Text can be styled using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to improve presentation (more on this below), and code is displayed nicely with syntax highlighting. Outputs from the interpreter (e.g., Python) such as returned values, tables, or plots, are displayed in HTML below executed cells. Both text and code can be edited and executed, creating an interactive document that can be shared."

The text you see above is written in Markdown, which provided a simple way to create large and bold font in headers, bullet points, and links. You can double-click on any Markdown cell to see the underlying *code* that creates the styled text. This can be a great way to learn Markdown, by reading examples. In addition, it will be useful to read through a full [Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) sometime to see the full capabilities of this language. "

You can then edit the content. When finished editing you will need to *execute* the cell again to return the text to its rendered state. To execute a notebook cell hold the shift key down and press enter: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>. You can also double-click this cell to examine the Markdown, which includes an example of how I created the key-stroke buttons for shift and enter. \n",

When you edit and execute the cell you should see large bold formatted text on the first line, followed by normal formatted text for the second line. If not, try editing the text again, you may have included spaces, or other errors. \n",

Execute the Code cell below by selecting the cell with you cursor and pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>. You should see a value returned in the output region below the cell.
